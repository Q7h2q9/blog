4.17，周四

刷到一个很吸引我的视频：[我尽力了！老外摄影师替你沉浸式体验中国退休后生活 bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV14QdDYiEXk/?spm_id_from=333.1391.0.0)

存一句感触颇深的话：

“A few months ago, I stood outside the fence thinking that I had to be good enough at the game to fit into this group. I was so wrong. This actually has little to do with ball skills, although it can be helpful. But what really matters is to be present, then do your best and enjoy... Enjoy every ball played with your fellow players. It's quite simple, right?”

“乒乓球是一项很棒的运动，但让乒乓更棒的是那些跟你一起打球的人”

“Looking through the fence, I knew I wanted to go inside. ”
